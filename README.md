### Business-Analytics-Nanodegree
This repository is dedicated to my Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree Projects.

In this program, my objective is to master data fundamentals applicable to any industry and learn to make data-driven decisions. By collecting and analyzing data to modeling business scenarios, I learned and levereaged Excel, SQL, and Tableau, as well as honing data visualization skills to communicate findings.

## Part 1: Introduction to Data Analysis

In this project, I explored an interactive data dashboard about Top Skills reported on LinkedIn to uncover insights. Then I created a short report explaining each insight, and how I found the information to reach my conclusion from the dashboard.

## Part 2: Introduction to Data

In this project, I've used statistics and spreadsheet programs (Excel) to analyze data from over 500 companies on the New York Stock Exchange. In particular, I created a Profit & Loss statement with an S&P 500 company selector widget in Excel. I also used Excel to create a dynamic income statement, where I forecasted financial metrics based on three possible scenarios for a company of choice from the NYSE dataset. Lastly, I analyzed the change in terms of Cost-of-good-sold between Year 1 and Year 3 for Materials Sector.

## Part 3: SQL for Data Analysis

In this project, I queried a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. I used the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices.
